# Instruction-Set-Design-for-RISC-V

This project focuses on the design of a custom instruction set for a RISC-V CPU,
which includes the implementation of main components: Program Counter, ALU,
Register File, Control Unit, and Memory Units. The designed custom instruction
set supports arithmetic, some logical, and some branching operations. The key goals
here are to document the design of such components, describe associated control
signals, show data flow, and include a sample program illustrating the functionality
of a custom CPU. The project also covers basics of implementing instructions in
RARS.
